## Project Description

This web application represents a small-scale project designed as an introductory showcase of Vue.js framework capabilities. Utilizing an API developed specifically for this purpose, the application revolves around a well-known mobile game, Arknights. 
Users can efficiently explore and retrieve basic information about various game operators up to a specified threshold through the search functionality provided.

**Note:** The API it uses is off Render's free tier, so your first few requests might take a minute.
